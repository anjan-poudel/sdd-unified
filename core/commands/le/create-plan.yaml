      task: |
        As the Lead Engineer, your task is to create a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan.
        Read the following artifacts from the feature workspace 'features/{{feature}}':
        - spec.yaml
        - design.md
        - review.md

        Synthesize these documents to produce a comprehensive implementation plan.
        The plan should be written to `features/{{feature}}/plan.md`.
        The plan must break down the implementation into granular tasks, estimate effort, and identify dependencies.
