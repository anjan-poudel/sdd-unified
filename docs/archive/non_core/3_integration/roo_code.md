# Roo Code Integration Guide

Roo integration follows the same architecture and file layout as Claude integration:

- `claude_code.md` (workflow model, required files, caveats)
- `../archive/legacy/guides/roo_guide.md` (legacy operational walkthrough)

Required project-local config directory remains:
- `.sdd_unified/`
