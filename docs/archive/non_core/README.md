# Non-Core Archive

This folder contains docs that are valid but not part of the active core set.

Typical reasons:
- historical analysis
- optional integrations
- duplicate or overlapping guides
- deep reference material not needed for day-to-day usage

Includes full-length architecture references:
- `2_architecture/overview-full.md`
- `2_architecture/workflow_engine-full.md`
- `2_architecture/context_management-full.md`
- `2_architecture/iterative_reviews-full.md`

Use active docs first via:
- `../../INDEX.md`
- `2_architecture/task_driven_implementation-full.md`
- `6_analysis/framework_assessment-full.md`
