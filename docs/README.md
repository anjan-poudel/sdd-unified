## Framework Status

**Current Version:** 1.0.0-alpha  
**Status:** Design Complete, Validation Needed  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-16

The framework is fully designed with comprehensive architecture, but requires validation with Claude Code or Roo Code to confirm runtime assumptions.

## Key Concepts

- **Configuration-Driven:** Pure YAML/JSON configuration, no imperative scripts
- **Agent-Based:** Specialized sub-agents (BA, Architect, PE, LE, Coder)
- **DAG Workflow:** Directed Acyclic Graph defines task dependencies
- **BDD Verification:** Gherkin acceptance criteria for all implementation tasks
- **Iterative Reviews:** Formal review/rework cycles with circuit breakers
