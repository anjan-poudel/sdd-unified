# Best Practices

## Delivery Defaults

1. Start in manual/supervised mode before autonomous execution.
2. Use pair sessions (driver + challenger) for T1/T2 work.
3. Keep formal reviews independent from producing pair.
4. Require evidence-based gates (tests/checks), not confidence-only decisions.
5. Maintain requirement-to-task-to-test traceability in `context.json`.
