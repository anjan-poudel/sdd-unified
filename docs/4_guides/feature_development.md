# Feature Development Guide

## Standard Execution Path

1. Set up project files: `../1_getting_started/installation.md`
2. Run first feature flow: `../1_getting_started/day1_checklist.md`
3. Apply pair/review controls: `../2_architecture/pair_review_overlay.md`
4. Use full DAG playbook when needed: `../../PLAYBOOK.md`

## Operating Rule

Treat this as the canonical day-to-day workflow entry point for delivery teams.
