# Multi LLM brainstorming during planning.

## Why
I have interestingly noted that all models have different style and strengths. if we can get them to **brainstorm** ( propose/feedback/fix cycle loop) 
then we can distill the best ideas/designs from each mode. Then we can create better prompts or plans with the synthesis.

We should be able to design autonomous coding assistant system that can synthesize ideas from multiple LLMs,
and build best of class software and systems.

## How
- Single prompt, multiple LLM : ask multiple ai assistants or LLMs to generate planning prompt for an idea or product feature.
- review & synthesis: then pick one or more agents to review the prompts and recommend a synthesis of the llm prompts to plugin any known gaps in design/impl.
 This can be an iterative process. 
- Brainstorming: chatgpt,sonnet,gemini and deepseek models have different strengths and thye can contribute to ideas and planning differently
  bringing different ideas and ay of thinking.
