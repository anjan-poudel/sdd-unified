# T013: Artifact Contract and Task I/O Schema

**Phase:** 1 (Core Engine)
**Status:** PENDING
**Dependencies:** T002 (workflow system)
**Size:** S (4 days)
**Source:** Synthesized-Codex (GAP-L2-002)

## Context

Tasks currently declare `outputs: ["requirements.md"]` as raw file paths. Downstream tasks consume these outputs without any type or schema check. A malformed or missing output silently breaks all downstream consumers with cryptic errors.

Artifact contracts introduce versioned, typed output declarations so incompatibilities are caught **at load time** before any LLM call is made.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Artifact contract validation

  Scenario: Compatible producer/consumer passes
    Given task A declares output: "requirements.md" with contract "requirements_doc@1"
    And task B declares input: "requirements.md" with contract "requirements_doc@1"
    When the workflow loads
    Then validation passes with no errors

  Scenario: Incompatible contracts fail at load time
    Given task A declares output contract "requirements_doc@1"
    And task B declares input contract "requirements_doc@2"
    When the workflow loads
    Then a validation error is raised: "artifact contract mismatch: requirements.md (producer: v1, consumer: v2)"
    And no tasks execute

  Scenario: Missing output at runtime fails with clear message
    Given task A is configured to produce "requirements.md" with contract "requirements_doc@1"
    When task A completes without writing "requirements.md"
    Then a post-task validation error is raised
    And the task is marked FAILED with reason "missing declared output: requirements.md"
    And downstream tasks are not executed

  Scenario: Artifact present but missing required section
    Given contract "requirements_doc@1" requires section "acceptance_criteria"
    When task A produces "requirements.md" without an "acceptance_criteria" section
    Then a post-task validation error is raised: "artifact requirements.md missing required section: acceptance_criteria"

  Scenario: Unknown contract type used
    Given a task declaring output contract "unknown_type@1"
    When the workflow loads
    Then a validation error is raised: "unknown artifact type: unknown_type"

  Scenario: No contract declared (backward compat)
    Given a task with outputs declared as bare file paths (no contract)
    When the workflow loads
    Then no contract validation occurs
    And a deprecation warning is emitted
```

## Artifact Schema Registry

```yaml
# artifacts/schema.yaml
version: "1"

artifact_types:
  requirements_doc:
    version: "1"
    description: "Formal requirements document produced by BA agent"
    file_format: markdown
    required_sections:
      - functional_requirements
      - non_functional_requirements
      - acceptance_criteria

  design_l1:
    version: "1"
    description: "L1 architecture document produced by Architect agent"
    file_format: markdown
    required_sections:
      - architecture_overview
      - component_map
      - api_contracts
      - data_models

  design_l2:
    version: "1"
    file_format: markdown
    required_sections:
      - component_specifications
      - interface_contracts

  review_log:
    version: "1"
    file_format: json
    required_fields:
      - decision
      - feedback
      - iteration
      - timestamp

  implementation_tasks:
    version: "1"
    file_format: markdown
    required_sections:
      - task_list
      - acceptance_criteria
```

## Workflow YAML with Contracts

```yaml
tasks:
  define-requirements:
    agent: ba
    inputs: []
    outputs:
      - path: requirements.md
        contract: requirements_doc@1

  design-l1:
    agent: architect
    inputs:
      - path: requirements.md
        contract: requirements_doc@1    # compatibility checked at load time
    outputs:
      - path: design/l1.md
        contract: design_l1@1

  review-l1:
    agent: reviewer
    inputs:
      - path: design/l1.md
        contract: design_l1@1
    outputs:
      - path: review/l1.json
        contract: review_log@1
```

---

## Validation Logic

**At load time** (workflow_loader.py):
1. For each task input with a contract, find the upstream task that produces the same path.
2. Check producer's declared contract version matches consumer's expected version.
3. Check artifact type exists in the registry.
4. Raise load-time validation error for any mismatch.

**At runtime** (post-task hook):
1. After task completes, check all declared outputs exist.
2. For markdown artifacts: check required sections are present (h2 headings).
3. For JSON artifacts: check required fields are present.
4. On failure: mark task FAILED with specific reason.

---

## Version Compatibility

Semantic versioning for contracts:
- Major version change → incompatible (must explicitly declare).
- Minor version change → forward-compatible (consumer @1 can accept producer @1.1).

```python
def is_compatible(producer: str, consumer: str) -> bool:
    """True if producer version satisfies consumer requirement."""
    # "requirements_doc@1" == "requirements_doc@1.x" (minor compat)
    # "requirements_doc@2" != "requirements_doc@1" (major mismatch)
```

---

## Implementation Notes

- `artifacts/schema.yaml` is the single artifact type registry.
- Validation runs in `workflow_loader.py` at parse time (load-time) and in a post-task hook (runtime).
- Backward compatibility: bare file path outputs (no contract) are allowed but emit a deprecation warning.
- Compatibility errors include the artifact path, producer task, consumer task, and version mismatch details.

---

## Files to Create

- `artifacts/schema.yaml`
- `artifacts/validator.py`
- `artifacts/compatibility.py`
- `tests/test_artifact_validator.py`
- `tests/test_artifact_compatibility.py`

---

## Test Strategy

- Unit tests: compatible versions pass; major version mismatch fails.
- Unit tests: missing output at runtime → FAILED with clear reason.
- Unit tests: required section missing → FAILED with section name.
- Unit tests: unknown contract type → load error.
- Integration test: workflow with full contract declarations validates and runs end-to-end.

## Rollback/Fallback

- Contract validation failure at load time: emit error, do not execute.
- Runtime output validation failure: mark NEEDS_REWORK, persist state, do not advance.
- If artifact schema registry is missing **and any task declares a contract**: hard startup
  error — "artifact schema registry not found but contracts are declared. Cannot validate."
- If artifact schema registry is missing **and no tasks declare contracts**: warn once at
  startup and continue (pure backward-compat mode for untyped legacy workflows).
- To explicitly allow mixed typed/untyped: pass `--allow-legacy-untyped-artifacts` flag.
  This must never be the silent default for new projects.
