# ai-sdd: Canonical Contracts Appendix

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for all normalized names, enums, and transaction
boundaries. Resolves any ambiguity between task files.

## 1. Tool Names

| Context | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ai-sdd init --tool` | `claude_code` | Installs `.claude/agents/` + `.claude/skills/` |
| `ai-sdd init --tool` | `codex` | Installs `AGENTS.md` |
| `ai-sdd init --tool` | `roo_code` | Installs `.roomodes` + `.roo/mcp.json` |
| `adapter.type` in `ai-sdd.yaml` | `claude_code` | Runtime: Claude Code subprocess |
| `adapter.type` in `ai-sdd.yaml` | `openai` | Runtime: OpenAI Chat Completions API |
| `adapter.type` in `ai-sdd.yaml` | `roo_code` | Runtime: Roo Code MCP path |
| `adapter.type` in `ai-sdd.yaml` | `mock` | Runtime: deterministic mock (tests) |

`--tool` controls the **UX integration files** installed in the project.
`adapter.type` controls the **LLM runtime** used by the engine.
They are independent — a project can use `--tool roo_code` with `adapter.type: openai`.

## 2. Task States

```
PENDING ──► RUNNING ──► COMPLETED
                │
                ├──► NEEDS_REWORK ──► RUNNING   (rework loop; feedback injected)
                │         └──────────► FAILED   (max_rework_iterations exceeded)
                │
                ├──► HIL_PENDING ──► RUNNING    (HIL resolved)
                │         └──────────► FAILED   (HIL rejected)
                │
                └──► FAILED
```

| State | Set by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PENDING` | Init | Not yet ready to run |
| `RUNNING` | Engine dispatch | Currently executing |
| `COMPLETED` | Engine post-task | Output produced, contract passed |
| `NEEDS_REWORK` | Evidence gate fail / reviewer NO_GO | Output rejected; agent must rerun with feedback |
| `HIL_PENDING` | HIL overlay | Waiting for human decision |
| `FAILED` | Engine on error / HIL reject / max iterations | Terminal; downstream tasks blocked |

**Invariant:** A task must never remain in `RUNNING` indefinitely.
Gate failure → `NEEDS_REWORK`. HIL trigger → `HIL_PENDING`. Crash → `FAILED`.

---

## 3. HIL Queue Item States

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PENDING` | Created; awaiting human acknowledgement |
| `ACKED` | Human has seen it |
| `RESOLVED` | Human approved; task unblocks |
| `REJECTED` | Human rejected; task transitions to `FAILED` |

---

## 4. Idempotency Keys

Two distinct keys per task execution:

| Key | Format | Stability | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `operation_id` | `workflow_id:task_id:task_run_id` | **Stable across retries and resume** | Sent to provider as idempotency header; dedup |
| `attempt_id` | `workflow_id:task_id:task_run_id:attempt_N` | Changes per retry | Observability / tracing only |

Rule: adapters send `operation_id` to the provider. Both IDs are logged in every
`task.started` / `task.retrying` event. `attempt_id` is never sent to the provider.

---

## 5. Evidence Gate Risk Tiers

| Tier | Evidence Required | Human Sign-off |
|---|---|---|
| `T0` | Acceptance evidence only | No |
| `T1` | Acceptance + verification (tests/lint/security) | No |
| `T2` | Acceptance + verification + operational readiness | **Always** |

Confidence score is **advisory only** at all tiers. It is included in the gate report but
never changes the pass/fail verdict.

## 7. `ai-sdd complete-task` Transaction Boundary

The `complete-task` command is the **single transaction boundary** for task completion.
It performs the following steps atomically — either all succeed or none are committed:

```
1. Validate output_path against project allowlist  → reject path traversal (../../)
2. Run security sanitization on content            → redact secrets, flag injection
3. Validate artifact contract                      → section/field presence check
4. Write file to output_path                       → atomic write (tmp + rename)
5. Update workflow state: task → COMPLETED         → atomic state file write
6. Update constitution manifest                    → manifest_writer hook
```

If any step fails, no state mutation occurs. The task remains in its prior state.

## 8. Config Namespace Summary

| Setting | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Secret redaction patterns | `security.secret_patterns` | Consumed by both sanitizer and observability |
| Injection detection level | `security.injection_detection_level` | `pass` / `warn` / `quarantine` |
| LLM adapter type | `adapter.type` | `claude_code` / `openai` / `roo_code` / `mock` |
| Constitution strict parse | `constitution.strict_parse` | `true` (default) = root malformed → hard error |
| Legacy untyped artifacts | CLI flag `--allow-legacy-untyped-artifacts` | Never a config file default |
| Concurrency budget | `engine.max_concurrent_tasks` | Semaphore on parallel dispatch |
| Cost budget | `engine.cost_budget_per_run_usd` | Pause → HIL when exceeded |
| Observability log level | `observability.log_level` | `DEBUG` / `INFO` / `WARN` / `ERROR` |

---

## 9. Backward-Compatibility Modes

| Mode | How to activate | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **strict** (default for new projects) | No config needed | Root constitution malformed → error; contracts declared + missing registry → error |
| **legacy** | `--allow-legacy-untyped-artifacts` CLI flag | Missing registry → warn + skip; submodule parse failure → warn + skip |

`legacy` mode is for gradual adoption only. Projects should migrate to `strict` mode.
There are no hidden permissive fallbacks — every relaxation is explicit and flagged.
