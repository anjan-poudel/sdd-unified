risks:
  - id: R1
    risk: "Over-reliance on confidence score"
    impact: "Unsafe auto-approval"
    mitigation: "Enforce evidence-based gate as primary control."
  - id: R2
    risk: "Requirement coverage noise"
    impact: "False blocks or false confidence"
    mitigation: "Keep requirement coverage optional and tunable."
  - id: R3
    risk: "Overlay interaction complexity"
    impact: "Non-deterministic execution"
    mitigation: "Fix overlay order and test matrix per combination."
  - id: R4
    risk: "Provider/runtime instability"
    impact: "Pipeline flakiness"
    mitigation: "Adapter retries, circuit breakers, and mock fallback."
  - id: R5
    risk: "Human queue bottlenecks"
    impact: "Slow throughput"
    mitigation: "Risk-tier routing and queue SLA metrics."
  - id: R6
    risk: "Confidence overuse"
    impact: "Suboptimal routing"
    mitigation: "Never use confidence as standalone gate."
