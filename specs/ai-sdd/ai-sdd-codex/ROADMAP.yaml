risks:
  - id: R1
    risk: "Confidence overuse"
    mitigation: "Never use confidence as standalone gate"

    risk: "Noisy requirement coverage"
    mitigation: "Keep requirement coverage optional and tunable"
  - id: R3
    risk: "Overlay interaction complexity"
    mitigation: "Lock execution order and test composition matrix"
