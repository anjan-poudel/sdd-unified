# Elderly Assistant Prompt Synthesis (DeepSeek-Optimized)

**Synthesized from:** Gemini 3, Claude 4.6, GPT‑5.2, DeepSeek v3.1 — all three prompt levels per model
**Date:** 2026‑02‑25
**Purpose:** Cross‑LLM best‑of synthesis for Basic, AI‑Optimised, and Advanced prompt variants, incorporating the unique strengths of each LLM style.

---

## Synthesis Notes

Each variant takes the best structural and substantive contributions from all four LLMs:

| Contributor | Key strength preserved |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Gemini** | Clean domain framing; confidence‑routing logic; merge/consistency criteria |
| **Claude** | Phase‑0 scoping gate; sub‑phase granularity (3A–3D); “flag and continue” execution note; voice‑as‑convenience‑factor nuance |
| **GPT‑5.2** | North Star + non‑goals; evidence‑first FACTS/ASSUMPTIONS/DECISIONS/RISKS taxonomy; Gate Results summary; pragmatic voice‑model caveat |
| **DeepSeek** | Authority boundaries per agent; 6‑tier confidence scoring; tiered evidence weights; YAML schemas; 4‑level escalation path; power/offline tool gates |

**Guiding Principles:**
- Confidence is advisory, not a standalone gate.
- Evidence‑based progression over assumption‑based leaps.
- Surface uncertainty; never paper over it.
- Produce a specification that an engineering team can build from without returning for clarification on core decisions.

---

# VARIANT 1 — BASIC

---

**Role:** You are an expert AI Product Architect and Mobile Systems Designer.

**Task:** Design an implementation‑oriented system specification for an AI Assistant mobile app for elderly users from non‑English speaking backgrounds.

---

## Context & Target Audience

- **Users:** Elderly parents who find smartphones overwhelming due to language barriers, unfamiliar UI symbolism, cognitive decline (e.g., memory loss), or physical limitations (e.g., trembling hands).
- **Primary Goal:** Provide a frictionless, voice‑first, always‑on assistant that manages daily routines, health monitoring, communication, and entertainment — without requiring the user to navigate complex app interfaces.
- **Caregiver Role:** Family members must be able to remotely configure the system to remove technical burden from the elderly user.

---

## Core Functional Requirements

### 1. Voice‑First Interaction
- Full phone control by voice: check calendar, make calls, send messages, ask for help.
- Multilingual support with regional dialect tolerance out of the box.
- Voice personalisation via enrollment samples to adapt to the user’s accent and speech pacing.
- **Note:** Prefer speaker adaptation and voice‑profile approaches over training a custom model unless clearly justified.

### 2. Daily Routine & Reminders
- Proactive, persistent voice + text reminders: wake‑up, medication (nagging escalation until acknowledged), meals, exercise, sleep.
- Confirmation flows (“Did you take it?”) with missed‑dose handling and family notification on failure to respond.
- Google Calendar integration for appointments and important dates.

### 3. Health Monitoring & Emergency Response
- Bidirectional sync with Apple HealthKit and Google Health Connect.
- Threshold‑based alerts: when a critical vital (e.g., blood pressure) is breached — (1) confirm with user, (2) if unresponsive or confirmed, call emergency services, (3) notify pre‑nominated family contacts in priority order, (4) provide continuous voice reassurance (“Help is on the way”).
- All emergency thresholds and contacts configurable by family.

### 4. Communication & Notifications
- Voice‑based calls and messages (WhatsApp, SMS, phone).
- Smart notification filtering: read aloud only important messages; silently log the rest.
- Contact aliases supporting native language commands (e.g., “Call my son”).

### 5. Entertainment & Scheduled Media
- Scheduled playback: devotional music, yoga videos, news headlines at predefined times.
- On‑demand media via voice (“Play bhajans”, “Open YouTube”).
- Media yields immediately to emergency and medication‑reminder events.

### 6. Remote Configuration (Critical)
- Family caregiver portal (web + mobile) to push schedules, reminders, emergency contacts, health thresholds, language settings, and media playlists to the device in real time.
- All changes reflected on device within 60 seconds.
- Simplified in‑app configuration also available for direct user control.

### 7. Security & Authentication
- Voice biometrics as a **convenience factor** (not the sole authentication method).
- Numeric PIN as mandatory fallback.
- Health and personal data encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Consent model for notification reading and health monitoring.

### 8. Runtime & Reliability
- 24/7 always‑on background service.
- Offline‑capable for core features (reminders, basic voice commands, emergency).
- Graceful degradation when backend or network is unavailable.

---

## Constraints (Non‑Negotiable)

- Must account for iOS/Android background‑execution limits.
- Must support multilingual + dialect tolerance.
- Voice is a convenience auth factor; fallback PIN required.
- Define offline/degraded behavior for all core tasks.

---

## Required Deliverables

1. **Problem statement and user personas** (3–5 personas with language/dialect, health conditions, daily routine, key use cases).
2. **Functional and non‑functional requirements** (with IDs and measurable acceptance criteria).
3. **High‑level architecture** (mobile, backend, AI pipeline, health integrations, caregiver portal).
4. **Key data flows** (reminder, health‑alert, emergency, config‑sync).
5. **Security/privacy model and consent model**.
6. **MVP scope** (8–12 weeks) and phase roadmap.
7. **Risks, assumptions, and open questions**.

---

## Output Style

- Use clear headings, bullet points, and concise tables.
- Be specific and implementation‑oriented.
- Separate **FACTS**, **ASSUMPTIONS**, **DECISIONS**, and **RISKS**.
- Where choices exist, present options with trade‑off analysis.

---

# VARIANT 2 — AI‑OPTIMISED (Structured Agentic)

---

# BUILD SPEC: ElderAssist AI (Agentic Execution Mode)

**Execution Mode:** Sequential phases with acceptance‑gated progression
**Orchestration Rule:** Complete all checklist items and meet acceptance criteria before advancing to the next phase. Flag blockers explicitly — do not stall. State assumptions and proceed.

---

## North Star

**Goal:** Enable elderly users (non‑English speaking backgrounds) to safely and confidently use a smartphone via voice‑first interaction, while reducing caregiver burden through remote configuration and visibility.

**Non‑Goals (unless explicitly requested):**
- Fully replacing WhatsApp, Facebook, or YouTube UIs
- Training large custom speech models from scratch
- Diagnosing or treating medical conditions

**Key Design Constraints (non‑negotiable):**
- C1: Primary interactions must be completable by voice; UI is fallback only
- C2: Caregiver remote configuration must push changes to device in real time
- C3: Multilingual support required; prefer reuse of existing ASR/TTS over custom training
- C4: UI must be accessible to users with tremors, cognitive decline, and low digital literacy
- C5: System must approximate 24/7 availability; explain how given OS limits
- C6: Emergency calls/notifications must include false‑positive mitigation and consent controls

---

## Evidence‑First Rule

Separate your outputs into:
- **FACT:** Supported by documented platform behaviour or published evidence
- **ASSUMPTION:** Explicitly stated; flag how it could be validated
- **DECISION:** With rationale and alternatives considered
- **RISK:** With mitigation strategy

Never present an assumption as a fact.

---

## PHASE 0 — Scoping & Constraints

**Objective:** Confirm foundations before any design work begins.

**Steps:**
1. Confirm target platforms: iOS, Android, or both

---

## PHASE 3A — Daily Routine & Reminder Engine

**Steps:**
1. Design reminder data model: type, schedule, recurrence, escalation rules, acknowledgement states
2. Define escalation logic per reminder type: initial alert → repeat interval → family notification if unacknowledged after X minutes
3. Design delivery mechanism: local notification + voice TTS + screen overlay
4. Define acknowledgement vs. informational‑only reminders

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All reminder types listed: wake‑up, yoga, medication (×N daily), meals, bedtime, custom
- [ ] Escalation rules defined per type
- [ ] Voice acknowledgement flow designed (“Yes I’ve taken it” → mark complete)
- [ ] Missed reminder behaviour defined: log, notify family, escalate

**Acceptance Criteria:**

---

## PHASE 3B — Health Monitoring & Emergency Response

**Steps:**
1. List all monitored health metrics with units and normal/threshold ranges
2. Define HealthKit + Health Connect integration: polling interval, data types, permissions
3. Design threshold configuration schema (per‑metric min/max; who can set — family/clinician)
4. Design emergency response as a full state machine:
   - Threshold breached → user confirmation (10 sec) → no response or confirmed → emergency sequence
   - Emergency sequence: call emergency services → notify contacts in priority order → voice reassurance
5. Define retry logic and fallback contacts if initial calls fail
6. Design health summary dashboard for caregiver companion app

2. Define notification importance filter (critical / personal / promotional / system)
3. Design WhatsApp and SMS integration approach
4. Define contact alias system (e.g., “Call my son” → saved contact; supports native language aliases)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Voice command → action mapping for all communication intents
- [ ] Notification filter rules defined
- [ ] Contact alias system designed
- [ ] TTS voice speed and language configurable per user

**Acceptance Criteria:**

2. Define media source integrations (YouTube API, local files)
3. Design remote playlist management
4. Define voice control during playback (pause, next, volume, stop)
5. Define interruption priority: emergency > medication reminder > media

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All media types listed: music, yoga/exercise video, news briefing, custom
- [ ] YouTube and local playback integration specced
- [ ] Remote playlist configuration flow documented
- [ ] Resume behaviour after interruption defined

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Scheduled media yields immediately to emergency and medication events
- [ ] News briefing sourced from configurable feed and read in user’s language

---

## PHASE 4 — Remote Configuration System

**Objective:** Design the caregiver interface and backend that lets family configure the elderly user’s app.

**Steps:**
1. Design companion app features: reminder management, contacts, health thresholds, media playlists, language settings
2. Design config schema — versioned and auditable (who changed what, when)
3. Design real‑time push pipeline: change → backend → push → device acknowledgement
4. Define conflict resolution if device has pending offline changes when remote config arrives
5. Design activity/health summary view for family

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Config push latency ≤ 60 seconds end‑to‑end
- [ ] Config schema versioned with full audit trail
- [ ] Conflict resolution policy covers all identified edge cases
- [ ] A non‑technical family member can configure all core settings within 5 minutes

---

## PHASE 5 — UX & Accessibility

**Steps:**
1. Define UI principles: minimum tap targets (≥ 72px), font sizes, contrast ratios, voice‑only operation
2. Design idle/home screen state: what the user sees and hears when nothing is happening
3. Design voice activation: always‑listening wake word vs. button press (consider false activation risk)
4. Design for physical limitations: large buttons, tremor/shake tolerance, no complex gestures
5. Design cultural localisation: avoid Western‑centric icons, support RTL scripts, culturally appropriate defaults
6. Define onboarding: guided by family member, voice‑led, requires zero reading from elderly user

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can complete any core task in ≤ 3 voice commands
- [ ] App fully operable with screen off (voice only)
- [ ] No feature requires the user to type
- [ ] All screens pass WCAG 2.2 AA contrast minimum

---

## PHASE 6 — Security Model

**Steps:**
1. Design voice biometric auth: enrolment, verification, liveness detection, confidence thresholds
2. Design PIN fallback: lockout policy, family reset mechanism
3. Define encryption standards: at rest (device) and in transit (TLS 1.3 minimum)
4. Define repeated failed authentication behaviour
5. Define caregiver access controls: role‑based (admin vs. view‑only)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Voice auth cannot be bypassed without PIN
- [ ] Health and personal data encrypted at rest and in transit
- [ ] Family members cannot access raw health data without explicit consent configured at setup
- [ ] Compliance requirements (HIPAA/GDPR/local) mapped to specific implementation decisions

---

## PHASE 7 — Tech Stack & Implementation Plan

**Steps:**
1. Recommend full tech stack with justification per layer: mobile, backend, AI/ML, config push, health APIs, media, auth
2. For each AI/ML component: cloud vs. on‑device, model size, latency, fallback
3. Flag open‑source vs. commercial and licensing considerations
4. Define MVP scope (8–12 weeks): milestones, team roles, backlog
5. Define Phase 2+ roadmap

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Every component has a named technology — no TBDs
- [ ] On‑device vs. cloud matrix complete for all AI components
- [ ] Stack achievable by team of 3–5 engineers
- [ ] Licensing flags clear

---

## FINAL DELIVERABLE CHECKLIST

Before concluding, confirm all are present:

- [ ] System architecture (all components, boundaries, protocols)
- [ ] Voice pipeline spec with STT model selection and benchmark justification
- [ ] Intent taxonomy (≥ 40 commands)
- [ ] Emergency response state machine
- [ ] Remote config schema and push flow
- [ ] Full tech stack with justifications
- [ ] UX principles and accessibility spec
- [ ] Security model
- [ ] MVP implementation plan (8–12 weeks)
- [ ] Open questions log — decisions requiring human input before build begins
- [ ] Gate Results: PASS / FAIL for each phase

---

**Execution Note:** If a phase cannot be completed due to missing information, list the specific missing inputs, propose reasonable default assumptions clearly labelled as such, and proceed. Do not stall — flag and continue.

---

# VARIANT 3 — ADVANCED (Evidence‑Gated Multi‑Agent)

---

# AGENTIC BUILD SPEC v4 — ElderAssist AI
## Multi‑Agent, Evidence‑Gated, Confidence‑Routed, Decision‑Logged

**Execution Mode:** Multi‑agent, evidence‑gated, confidence‑routed
**Orchestration Principle:** No artifact proceeds without explicit evidence linkage. All assumptions must be logged and risk‑rated. Confidence scores below threshold trigger automatic rerouting. Execution never silently propagates low‑quality outputs.

---

## NORTH STAR

**Goal:**
- Enable elderly users to safely and confidently use a smartphone via voice‑first interaction.
- Reduce caregiver burden through remote configuration and real‑time visibility.
- Prioritise safety, privacy, reliability, and accessibility.

**Non‑Goals (unless explicitly requested):**
- Fully replacing WhatsApp, Facebook, or YouTube UIs
- Training large custom speech models from scratch
- Diagnosing or treating medical conditions
- Multi‑tenant caregiver management (Phase 2+)

**Priority Hierarchy (applied at every conflict):** Safety > Accessibility > Technical Feasibility > Cost

---

## AGENT ROSTER & AUTHORITY MATRIX

| Agent ID | Role | Primary Scope | Authority Boundaries |
|----------|------|---------------|----------------------|
| `ORCH` | Orchestrator | Phase sequencing, gate enforcement, conflict resolution, Decision Log, final merge | May override agent decisions ONLY when Safety > Accessibility conflict; must log rationale. Cannot override hard gates. |
| `ARCH` | Systems Architect | Overall architecture, data models, service boundaries, integration contracts | Cannot define UX patterns; must collaborate with `UX` on interface contracts |
| `ML` | ML/AI Engineer | STT/TTS pipeline, intent classification, voice biometrics, inference strategy | Cannot define security protocols; must collaborate with `SEC` on biometric implementation |
| `HEALTH` | Health & Safety Engineer | HealthKit/Health Connect integration, emergency state machine, threshold logic | Cannot define UX flows; must provide requirements to `UX` for emergency interfaces |
| `UX` | Accessibility & UX Designer | Elderly‑focused interface, cultural localisation, WCAG 2.2, onboarding flow | Cannot define technical implementation; provides specs to `ARCH`/`ML` |
| `SEC` | Security Engineer | Auth/privacy/compliance/threat model | Cannot override emergency protocols for security; must collaborate with `HEALTH` on balanced approach |
| `CONFIG` | Platform Engineer | Remote configuration system, companion app, push pipeline, audit logging | Cannot define user‑facing features; implements configuration delivery only |
| `MEDIA` | Media & Communications Engineer | Entertainment scheduling, WhatsApp/YouTube integration, TTS customisation | Cannot define health emergency interruptions; must accept `HEALTH` priority rules |
| `QA` | Quality & Acceptance | Evidence package review, confidence auditing, acceptance sign‑off | Has veto power on any deliverable with insufficient evidence; cannot define requirements |

**Required Collaborations:**
- Pair reviews: `ML` + `SEC` (biometrics), `HEALTH` + `UX` (emergency interfaces), `ARCH` + `CONFIG` (config architecture)
- Triad sign‑offs: Any security‑critical health feature requires `HEALTH` + `SEC` + `QA` joint approval
- Conflict escalation: Agent → Pair review → `ORCH` → Human decision point

---

## CONFIDENCE SCORING PROTOCOL

Every agent output must include an explicit confidence declaration:

```
CONFIDENCE: [0–100]
BASIS: [evidence supporting this score]
GAPS: [unknowns or explicit assumptions]
ROUTE: [see table below]
```

| Score | Label | Definition | Routing Action |
|-------|-------|------------|----------------|
| 95–100 | Verified | Direct evidence from authoritative source, no material assumptions | ✅ Auto‑approve; gate check runs |
| 85–94 | High Confidence | Strong evidence; minor assumptions explicitly logged | ✅ Proceed with assumptions logged |
| 75–84 | Medium Confidence | Single strong source; significant assumptions; risk mitigation stated | ⚠️ Conditional proceed; `QA` review required |
| 65–74 | Low Confidence | Weak evidence; major assumptions; high risk | 🔁 Reroute for additional research before resubmission |
| 50–64 | Speculative | Mostly assumption‑based; no authoritative source | 🔁 Mandatory reroute; evidence gathering required |
| 0–49 | Unsubstantiated | No credible evidence; critical unknowns | 🚫 Hard stop; `ORCH` escalates to human decision point |

**Confidence Routing Logic:**
- If phase average score ≥ 85: proceed to next phase
- If phase average score < 85 AND iteration count < 3: route critique to responsible agent(s) for mandatory rework
- If iteration count = 3: halt, trigger HIL gate, escalate to human with full iteration history

**Rule:** Confidence scores must never be inflated to pass a gate. `QA` audits all scores ≥ 90 on critical‑path items. Any score that cannot be substantiated by cited evidence is downgraded automatically.

---

## EVIDENCE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

**Tier 1 (Weight: 10×) — Primary Sources:**
- Official API documentation (Apple HealthKit, Google Health Connect, WhatsApp Business API)
- Published benchmark studies (WER for multilingual STT; FAR/FRR for biometrics)

- Case studies of comparable deployed systems

**Tier 3 (Weight: 2×) — Supporting:**
- Community documentation, analogous system analysis, logical derivation from first principles

**Tier 4 (Weight: 1×) — Anecdotal:**
- Unverified claims, assumptions pending validation

**Minimum Evidence Requirements per Phase:**

| Phase | Tier 1 Min | Total Min | Special Requirement |
|-------|------------|-----------|----------------------|
| 0 — Scoping | 2 | 8 | Must include stakeholder need validation |
| 1 — Architecture | 5 | 20 | Must include scalability and failure mode analysis |

## MANDATORY TOOL GATES

| Gate ID | Tool / Process | Triggering Agent | Gate Condition | Failure Impact |
|---------|----------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| `TG‑01` | API documentation retrieval | `ARCH`, `ML`, `HEALTH` | Before finalising any external API integration claim | Blocks integration design |
| `TG‑02` | HealthKit + Health Connect capability verification | `HEALTH` | Before Phase 3B begins | Blocks health feature design |
| `TG‑03` | STT model benchmarking (WER, dialect coverage) | `ML` | Before voice pipeline finalisation | Blocks model selection |
| `TG‑04` | Regulatory compliance mapping | `SEC` | Before security architecture finalisation | Blocks compliance design |
| `TG‑05` | WCAG 2.2 + elderly UX guidelines retrieval | `UX` | Before UX patterns finalised | Blocks interface design |
| `TG‑06` | Emergency services API availability per region | `HEALTH` | Before emergency call flow design | Blocks emergency design |
| `TG‑07` | Voice biometrics FAR/FRR benchmarking | `ML`, `SEC` | Before authentication design | Blocks auth design |
| `TG‑08` | Dependency license audit | `ARCH` | Before tech stack finalisation | Blocks stack selection |
| `TG‑09` | OS background task / battery impact analysis | `ML`, `ARCH` | Before background operation design | Blocks runtime design |
| `TG‑10` | Offline capability verification per feature | `ARCH` | Before core feature specification | Blocks offline strategy |

**Tool Gate Failure Protocol:**

- **Level 1 (Missing data):** Agent documents search methodology, lists alternatives attempted, proposes assumption with risk rating (Low/Medium/High/Critical). `ORCH` decides: proceed with risk flag, or halt. Execution may continue only if risk ≤ Medium.
- **Level 2 (Conflicting data):** Agent presents all conflicting sources with evidence tier weighting applied. `QA` arbitrates if confidence < 80.
- **Level 3 (No data available):** Immediate halt of affected phase branch. Escalate to human decision point. Log as blocking OQ. Consider architectural pivot if issue is critical.

```

**Parallel Phase Rule:** Phases 2, 4, 5, and 6 execute simultaneously after Phase 1 merges. Any cross‑phase dependency requires a **dependency handshake**: producing agent declares output ready; consuming agent confirms receipt and compatibility before proceeding.

---

## UNIVERSAL MERGE CRITERIA (All Phases)

---

## PHASE‑SPECIFIC MERGE CRITERIA (Summary)

| Phase Gate | Key Additional Criteria |
|------------|-------------------------|
| **Phase 0 → 1** | Platform confirmed; language list specific (not just family — regional variants); compliance jurisdiction mapped |

| **Phase 6 → Phase 7** | Emergency flow security signed off by `HEALTH` + `SEC`; compliance obligations mapped to specific implementations |
| **Phase 7 Final** | All prior criteria satisfied; full stack named; licensing clear; cost envelope estimated |

---

## CONFLICT RESOLUTION PROTOCOL

When two agents produce conflicting outputs:

1. Both agents state position with supporting evidence
2. `ORCH` identifies decision criteria and applies weighted priority: **Safety > Accessibility > Feasibility > Cost**
3. `ORCH` applies the weighted decision
4. The losing position is logged in the Decision Log with rationale — it is not discarded
5. If `ORCH` confidence < 70, the conflict is escalated as a blocking OQ to a human decision point

---

## OPEN QUESTIONS REGISTER

`ORCH` maintains throughout execution:

```
OQ‑[ID] | Phase Raised | Agent | Question | Blocking? | Assumption Used | Risk | Status
```

**Rules:**
- Every gap from every Evidence Package generates an OQ entry
- Blocking OQs halt the relevant phase branch until resolved
- Non‑blocking OQs require a stated assumption and risk rating
- All OQs resolved or formally deferred (with owner) before Final Deliverable is issued

## ESCALATION PATH

| Level | Trigger | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Agent‑level conflict or low confidence | Agent → Pair review attempt |
| 2 | Pair unresolved after 2 cycles | Pair → `ORCH` mediation |
| 3 | `ORCH` confidence < 70 or blocking OQ | `ORCH` → Human decision point; execution halted on branch |
| 4 | Fundamental feasibility issue | Architecture pivot consideration; full impact analysis required |

## FINAL DELIVERABLE PACKAGE

`ORCH` confirms all volumes complete before execution is considered done:

| Volume | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| **V1: Architecture & Design** | System architecture, data models, API contracts, scalability plan |
| **V2: AI & Voice** | STT/TTS pipeline spec, intent taxonomy (≥ 40 intents), voice biometrics flow, confidence thresholds |
| **V3: Feature Specs** | Reminder engine state machine, emergency response state machine, communication flows, media interruption priority matrix |
| **V4: Platform & Config** | Remote config schema (versioned), push pipeline, companion app spec, audit logging |
| **V5: Security & Compliance** | Security model, compliance mapping, threat model, incident response |
| **V6: UX & Accessibility** | UX principles (WCAG AA evidence), cultural localisation per language, onboarding flow |
| **V7: Implementation Guide** | Tech stack (with licensing + cost), on‑device vs. cloud matrix, MVP roadmap (8–12 weeks), test strategy |
| **V8: Governance** | Decision Log, Open Questions Register (all resolved), Assumptions Register (with validation status), Risk Register |

**STANDING EXECUTION DIRECTIVE:** Evidence over assumption. Specificity over generality. Surface uncertainty — never paper over it. Produce a specification that an engineering team can build from without returning for clarification on core decisions.

## Recommended Use

- Use **Basic** for fast ideation and one‑shot design.
- Use **AI‑Optimised** for reliable structured outputs from general LLM runs.
- Use **Advanced** for agentic workflows, governance‑heavy environments, or high‑stakes planning.
