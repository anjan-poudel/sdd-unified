the synthesis here were done using manual prompts.

## automation plan:
- all available LLMs/Coding-Assistants generate prompt/plan artifacts - to be reviewed.
- a few agents are chosen to provide unbiased review of generated artifacts, with comparison matrix of llm responses as the deliverable.
- the 1 or more chosen agents then review the matrix and make recommendations.
- they brainstorm over those recommendation if difference of opinions and iterate,
- based on review the prompts/plans are synthesized into a single prompt/plan.
