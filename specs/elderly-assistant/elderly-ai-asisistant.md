Think ultra deep and conduct a research on Designing and providing details of components and systems required to build an AI Assistant app for Elderly people.
The app is mainly targeted for elderly parents from non english speaking background who find using smartphones overwhelming for various reasons.
But at the same time they want to use some apps like youtube and facebook, whatsApp etc for entertainment and to connect with their children living in different country or city/location.

The main goal is to help them with their day to day routines like medication reminders (voice/text), exercise reminders,
calendars and important dates ( integration with google calendar etc for now), entartainment and staying in touch with loved ones.

other goals:
- connect with apple/android health api and fetch and push data to and from health platform to device.
  E.g when blood pressure goes above a threshold, assistant will call emergercy service as well as notify family members.
  Assistant can let parent know help is on its way, and it can additionally dial pre-nominated numbers during emergency
  ( son/daughter/wife/husband/children/etc).
- read messages and notifications if notifications are important.
- read news at predefined time
- play music ( bhajan etc) at predefined time
- play yoga video etc at predefined time
- wake up, yoga, medication, lunch, snacks, dinner, etc voice (naggin ones for medications) reminders.

Elderly parents from non speaking background find it difficult to use the phone not only due to language
but also due to symbolism and culture.
E.g, some elderly parents with cognitive decline can't remember how to  pick up phone or have shaking hands etc.

With the ai assistant,
Elderly people can use their voice to ask the assistant to check calendar, check medication schedule, call people
Text people, read text and notifications etc and ask it to explain things or ask for assistance when using phone etc.

config:
- the app can be remotely configured by the people for their parents ( pushes config to app)
  this is really important as loved ones should be able to set schedules and reminders etc and othe settings.
- can be configured in-app

Voice training:
- small voice/text model will be trained to recognise the person's accent,nuances etc by providing
  some voice samples and then getting ot to recognise voice and also understand what the person is asking/saying.
  ideally the model should be able to recognise regional dialects already.

Runtime:
runs 24/7

Security:
- voice as fingerprint
- backup pin number
-
